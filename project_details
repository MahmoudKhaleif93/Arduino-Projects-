NTC Sensor and inverters integration test:


in Automotive companies, the DCAC inverters have been produced as Gate board , Control Board and Power modules (IGBTs) in this project i ll build a Demo_Board to show the integration of the IGBTs sensor with the motor and how could the car safely stop once there is a high temperature. the project will be on different parts. the main programming language is embedded C on Arduino.
